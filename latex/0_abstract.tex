\section*{Abstract}

This thesis investigates swaption pricing using the SABR (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho) model,
combined with a motivation for swaption as a missing link i asset allocation. 
\\\\
Then the thesis examines the necessity for a two-factor model, to handling stochastic volatility.
The SABR model is chosen to modeling implied volatility and pricing swaption. 
This choice is made from investigating the Vasicek model and a discussion of constant volatility.
\\\\
Furthermore the thesis concludes on the parameters investigation and the risk related to the SABR model. 
Which should be taking into a count, if swaption should take part in asset allocation.
Finally the thesis suggest that swaptions fill a critical gap in asset allocation by providing 
positive performance in market conditions where traditional asset classes, 
such as equities and bonds, may under perform. This positions swaptions as a valuable addition to diversified portfolios.
