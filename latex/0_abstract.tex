\section*{Abstract}
This thesis investigates the fundamental driver affecting swaption prices, 
with a specific focus on utilizing the SABR (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho) model for pricing.
The analysis emphasizes the importance of model selection, as it significantly impacts swaption prices.
\\\\
Chapters 4 and 5 motivate the selection of a two-factor model, driven by market data that indicates a
need for handling stochastic volatility. The analysis in Chapter 7 reveals that the parameters within the 
SABR model $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\rho$ and $\nu$ have distinct effects on implied volatility and swaption prices. 
Observing similar patterns in $\nu$ and $\beta$, $\beta$ is fixed.
In Chapter 8, it is demonstrated that observed implied volatility can be constructed from market data using 
the SABR model.
\\\\
Chapter 9 highlights the risks associated with the SABR model, identifying crucial market movements 
to monitor when using swaptions in asset allocation. The findings suggest that swaptions fill a critical 
gap in asset allocation by providing positive performance in market conditions where traditional asset classes, 
such as equities and bonds, may under perform. This positions swaptions as a valuable addition to diversified 
investment portfolios.
