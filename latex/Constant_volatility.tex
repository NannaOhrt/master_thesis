\section{Constant Volatility}
The Black-Scholes model, introduced earlier, outlines the pricing formula for a European call option in 
Proposition \autoref{Black-Scholes Formula}. It is  essential to recall that in the Black-Scholes formula, 
volatility is considered constant. This implies that the volatility of the asset's returns does not vary over time,
establishing a direct correlation between the option's price and its volatility. Consequently, 
understanding implied volatility becomes crucial. Although the Black-Scholes model does not provide 
a closed-form solution for implied volatility, it can be determined numerically, a topic not covered 
in this analysis. Instead, we introduce the SABR model to estimate volatility, which can then be 
applied to the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.

We will briefly demonstrate why the assumption of constant volatility does not align with market data. 
Our analysis includes examining the S$\&$P 500 index and the 10Y10Y EUR swaption, which are commonly used financial indices.
