\section{Mathematics of pricing swaptions}
To determine swaptions prices, it is important to understand which things there affects the price of the swaption. 
This chapter simplifies these concepts by explaining interest rates, bonds, swaps, and options, 
and then shows how they come together to determine the price of a swaption.
\subsection{Time value of money}
Understanding the concept of interest rates begins with the fundamental idea that a dollar today holds 
more value than the same dollar in the future. To understand these concept, a discount factor is introduce 
\begin{align*}
    B(t,T) = \text{value at time t of a dollar received at time T}
\end{align*} 
$B(t,T)$ refer to a contract that pays one dollar maturity, T, which can be illustrated as below
\begin{align*}
    t & < T \rightarrow B(t,T) < 1 \\
    t & = T \rightarrow B(t,T) = 1
\end{align*}
The concept "time value of money" it asserts that the value of money today is worth more than
the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity, inflation, and risk.
This principle underpins various financial decisions, including investing, borrowing,
and pricing financial instruments. Essentially, it recognizes that a dollar received today can be invested 
and earn interest over time, thereby increasing its value. Conversely, a dollar received in the future
is subject to uncertainty and may not retain its purchasing power due to inflation or other factors.
The discount factor represents the present value of future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money.
It reflects the idea that receiving a certain amount of money in the future is less valuable than receiving 
the same amount today.
\subsection{Zero coupon bonds}
One of the most common applications of the concept "time value of money" is zero coupon bonds. 
By there construction the mechanism of "time value of money" is present. This instrument 
have the common property that they provide the owner with a deterministic cash flow. 
\begin{definition}\label{def:zcb}
    A zero coupon bond with maturity data T, also called a T-bons, is a contract which 
    guarantees the holder one dollar to be paid on the date T. The price at time t of 
    a bond with maturity data T is denoted by p$(t,T)$ \cite{Bjork} 
\end{definition} 
\subsection{The yield curve}
Where the concept "time value of money" and the discount factor are fundamental concepts used to assess the present value of future
cash flows, while the yield curve provides insights into market expectations regarding future interest rates.
Understanding the interplay between these concepts is crucial for making informed investment decisions and pricing
financial instruments. The yield curve is a graphical representation illustrating the interest rates (bond yields) for various maturities.
Yield curve can provide a intuition about future interest rates and give insight in the bond market today. 
The general intuition is that longer-term rates is higher then short-term rates, which in other words means that a
lager premium is expect for lending money over a longer period of time. This case sketches a yield cure with a 
positive slope.
\subsection{Interest rates}
\subsubsection{Spot rates}
The spot rate represents the yield-to-maturity of a zero coupon bond,
while the forward rate refers to the anticipated interest rate in the 
future. The definition for determined spot rates is listed 
below
\begin{definition}\label{def:spot}
    The simple spot rate for $[S,T]$, henceforth referred to as the 
    LIBOR spot rate, is defined as \cite{Bjork} 
    \begin{align*}
        L(t;S,T) = - \frac{p(t,T)-p(t,S)}{(T-S)p(t,T)}
    \end{align*}
\end{definition} 
\subsubsection{Forward rates}
Forward rates play a crucial role in financial markets, particularly in the realm of interest rate analysis and 
derivative pricing. They represent the interest rate applicable to a future period, agreed upon today.
Understanding forward rates requires grasping the concept of forward contracts and the expectations theory of interest rates.
Forward rates can be derived from the yield curve. The yield curve plots the yields of bonds with different maturities.
By analyzing the yield curve, one can infer the implied forward rates for future periods. For example, 
the forward rate between year 1 and year 2 is the rate at which an investor can borrow or lend money for the period
between year 1 and year 2, starting at year 1.
\\\\
Lets consider three time points on the yield curve $t=0,1,2$, where it is assumed
that $t_0 < t_1 < t_2$. At time $t_0$ we have the spot rates $p(t_0,t_1)$ and $p(t_1,t_2)$,
which represent the yields for bonds maturing at time $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively.
Hence the forward rate, $R(t_1,t_2)$, can med determined using the equation below
\begin{align*}
    R(t_1,t_2)= \frac{(1+p(t_0,t_2))^2}{(1+p(t_0,t_1))}-1
\end{align*}
Imagine investing one dollar in a one-year zero-coupon bond, $B(t_0,t_1)$,
and instantly reinvesting the money received at time $t_1$ in a new one-year zero-coupon bond,
$B(t_1,t_2)$, at rate $R(t_1,t_2)$. This strategy should yield the same return as investing 
one dollar in a two-year zero coupon bond $B(t_0,t_2)$ and holding it for two years. 
This strategy illustrated the idea of forward rates. Let us then look a the general
formula for forward rates. 
\begin{definition}\label{def:forward}
    The continuously compounded forward rate for $[S,T]$ contracted at t is defined
    as \cite{Bjork} 
    \begin{align*}
        R(t;S,T)= - \frac{\log p(t,T)- \log p(t,S)}{(T-S)} 
    \end{align*}
\end{definition} 
\subsection{Financial derivatives}
\subsubsection{Bonds}
A bond is a debt security, like a loan. Borrowers issue bonds to raise money 
from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.
When you purchase a bond you are lending money to the issuer, which in 
some cases a government or company. In return, from the construction of the 
bond, the issuer guarantees to pay a predetermined rate during the life of the bond
and repay the principal at maturity. 
\\\\
Earlier a zero coupon bond has introduced and when talk about bond, a zero coupon 
bond is the simplest representation of a bond. The zero coupon bond contract is 
only given by two cash flows. One for the buyer, there pays the issuer at time 
t = $t_0$, and another where the buyer receives the principal at time t = T.
Unlike other types of bonds, a zero coupon bond does not offer periodic 
interest payments (coupons) throughout its term. \cite{Bjork} 
\\\\
The price of a zero coupon bond is represented as 
p(t,T), where an individual lends an amount, K, with the intention of earning a
return in the future. Therefore, the price of a zero coupon bond, with 
its principal (also known as face value) K, at time t and with maturity 
T, is denoted as.
\begin{align*}
    p(t,T)= B(t,T)\cdot K
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Fixed Coupon Bonds}
A describe a zero coupon bond does not involve coupons throughout the term of the bond. 
But moving forward we will introduce various bond with coupon there are either fixed 
or floating. First we will consider the simplest form of a coupon bond, which is a 
fixed coupon bond. Fixed coupon bonds are a type of debt security that offers investors a predictable
return in the form of regular interest payments, known as coupons, until the bond's maturity.
These coupons are set at a fixed rate at the time of issuance, based on the bond's face value,
and are typically paid annually or semi-annually. Upon reaching maturity, the issuer repays 
the principal amount (face value) to the bondholder, concluding the bond contract. The purpose
of a fixed coupon bond is there ability to provide a steady stream of income,
making them an attractive option for conservative investors seeking to minimize risk and 
secure predictable returns.
